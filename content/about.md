Hello! Ciao! Servus!

Let me introduce myself here at length. 

I was born in March 1987 with some roots in the mountaieous region of the Bavarian forest, with the middle name Karl, and grew up in the peaceful town GÃ¼ndlkofen in the Isar valley. Tennis courts, ski slopes and forests were the playgrounds of my childhood. After my high school degree I engaged in a 9-month civil service in a hospital, but chose to study physics. I enrolled at Ludwig Maximilians Univerity in Munich (LMU) and finished my B.Sc. in Physics plus Meteorology with a thesis at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain, investigating solar radiation measurement instruments, under the supervision of Stefan Wilbert. 
I picked up programming in MATLAB and developed a passion for visualizing my research. I went on a road trip and arrived at an 3-month internship at Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, looking into the Atlantic's anomalous oscillations, advised by Reik Donner. Then back at LMU I did my MSc. of Meteorology in the education of Berhard Mayer and George Craig as professors and their peers, but finisihing with a thesis on tornadic supercells in landfalling tropical cyclones supervised by Roger K. Smith. I then moved on to do a PhD on Earth System Modelling at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, researching on convectively generated gravity waves and convective aggregation, with Elisa Manzini and Cathy Hohenegger. Then I entered on a research cruise, crossing the Atlantic from Cape Verde to Guadeloupe, taking measurements of sea salt aerosols. I travelled southwards to Peru and came back to Europe for finding home in Trieste, Italy. At the International Center for Theoretical Physics in the Earth System Physics Section I
