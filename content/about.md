Hello! Ciao! Servus!

Let me introduce myself here at length. I was born in Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany on March 20th 1987 and grew up in the peaceful town GÃ¼ndlkofen in the Isar valley. Playing Tennis and running around in the forests were my main activities. After my high school degree I was doing a 9-month civil service in the nearest hospital, and figured out I wanted to study physics. In 2007 I enrolled at Ludwig-Maximilians-Univerity and finished my B.Sc. in Physics plus Meteorology in 2010. I very much benefited from writing my thesis at the "Plataforma Solar de Almeria", where I was researching on solar radiation measurement instruments. I picked up programming in MATLAB and quickly developed a passion for visualizing my research.
