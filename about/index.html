  <p>Hello! Ciao! Servus!</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself here at length.</p>
<p>I was born in March 1987 with some roots in the mountaieous region of the Bavarian forest, with the middle name Karl, and grew up in the peaceful town G端ndlkofen in the Isar valley. Tennis courts, ski slopes and forests were the playgrounds of my childhood. After my high school degree I engaged in a 9-month civil service in a hospital, but chose to study physics. I enrolled at Ludwig Maximilians Univerity in Munich (LMU) and finished my B.Sc. in Physics plus Meteorology with a thesis at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain, investigating solar radiation measurement instruments, under the supervision of Stefan Wilbert.
I picked up programming in MATLAB and developed a passion for visualizing my research. I went on a road trip and arrived at an 3-month internship at Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, looking into the Atlantic&rsquo;s anomalous oscillations, advised by Reik Donner. Then back at LMU I did my MSc. of Meteorology in the education of Berhard Mayer and George Craig as professors and their peers, but finisihing with a thesis on tornadic supercells in landfalling tropical cyclones supervised by Roger K. Smith. I then moved on to do a PhD on Earth System Modelling at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, researching on convectively generated gravity waves and convective aggregation, with Elisa Manzini and Cathy Hohenegger. Then I entered on a research cruise, crossing the Atlantic from Cape Verde to Guadeloupe, taking measurements of sea salt aerosols. I travelled southwards to Peru and came back to Europe for finding home in Trieste, Italy. At the International Center for Theoretical Physics in the Earth System Physics Section I</p>
